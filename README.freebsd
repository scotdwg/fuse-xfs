This is kind-of hacky, but I wanted to preserve the source
code in a buildable fashion for FreeBSD. This fuse-xfs isn't
readily available in the ports tree, and our pkg_src server
makes my head explode.

To build on FreeBSD you need to install a bunch of packages
(aclocal, automake, libtool, and probably a bunch I'm forgetting.

Hopefully, I've captured the tree in it's post configure state
so a build at this point from the source tree actually just
compiles everthing we need.
